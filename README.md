# CNN_EEG
This repository contains a CNN-based neural network model intended to classify motor imagery (MI) EEG data.
To add on I have compared few more models of CNN such as CNN-CNN and CNN-CNN-CRF

CNN-CNN : This ones used a 1D CNN for the epoch encoding and then another 1D CNN for the sequence labeling.
CNN-CNN-CRF : This model used a 1D CNN for the epoch encoding and then a 1D CNN-CRF for the sequence labeling.
